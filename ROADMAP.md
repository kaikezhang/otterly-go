## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: AI hallucinations (inaccurate recommendations)
- **Mitigation**: Verify with real-time APIs (Google Places, TripAdvisor), user reporting, confidence scoring

**Risk**: Scalability issues (database bottlenecks)
- **Mitigation**: Connection pooling, read replicas, Redis caching, database sharding

**Risk**: Third-party API failures (booking APIs down)
- **Mitigation**: Fallback providers, graceful degradation, error handling

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Low free-to-paid conversion
- **Mitigation**: A/B test paywalls, improve onboarding, add more value to Pro tier

**Risk**: High churn rate
- **Mitigation**: Engagement campaigns, re-activation emails, exit surveys, improve retention features

**Risk**: Booking platform competition (undercut commissions)
- **Mitigation**: Differentiate on planning experience, not just price

### Market Risks

**Risk**: ChatGPT adds booking features
- **Mitigation**: Build defensible moats (collaboration, templates, community), move faster
