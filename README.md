# ðŸ¦¦ OtterlyGo

A conversational, content-rich travel planner that helps you co-create realistic day-by-day itineraries through natural conversation.

## What It Does

OtterlyGo is an MVP that demonstrates:
- **Conversational planning**: Tell it about your trip, answer a few questions, and get a balanced day-by-day itinerary
- **Rich suggestions**: Request ideas and receive cards with images, traveler quotes (Chinese + English), and source links
- **One-click actions**: Add or replace activities in your itinerary with a single click
- **Local persistence**: Refresh the browser and your chat + itinerary are restored
- **No sign-in required**: Data stored in localStorage (no account needed)
- **Secure backend**: API keys protected server-side (Milestone 1.1)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# 4. Start both frontend and backend servers
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001

### Environment Configuration

Edit `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Optional (with defaults)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
PORT=3001
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Troubleshooting API Key Issues:**
- Make sure your API key starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`
- Check that your API key has credits at [platform.openai.com/account/billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
- Check backend console for detailed error messages
- If you get a 401 error, your API key is invalid
- If you get a 429 error, you've hit the rate limit (backend enforces 20 req/min)
- If you get a 402 error, add credits to your OpenAI account

**Test the backend:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

## How to Use

### Primary Use Case (Validation)

Try this flow to validate the MVP:

1. **Initial message**: "9 days in Peru, must see Machu Picchu, light hiking and culture"
2. **Answer follow-ups**: The assistant will ask about dates, pace (fast/medium/slow), and interests
3. **Review itinerary**: Once generated, you'll see a day-by-day plan in the right sidebar
4. **Request a suggestion**: "I have an extra day after Machu Picchu, suggest something"
5. **See Rainbow Mountain card**: Review images, quotes, and source links
6. **Add to itinerary**: Click "Add to Day 6" and see it appear in your plan
7. **Modify preferences**: Say "Less hiking, more food in Lima" and watch the plan update

### Features You Can Try

- **Add activities**: Click "+ Add suggestion" in any day
- **Replace items**: Hover over an activity and click "Replace"
- **Remove items**: Hover and click "Remove"
- **Request changes**: Ask for modifications like "more rest days" or "focus on food"
- **Refresh persistence**: Reload the browserâ€”your chat and itinerary are restored

## Architecture & Rationale

### Why These Choices?

**Frontend Stack**
- **React + TypeScript + Vite**: Fast, modern, type-safe development with instant HMR
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first styling for rapid UI development
- **Zustand + persist middleware**: Lightweight state management (~3KB) with built-in localStorage persistence

**Backend (Milestone 1.1)** âœ…
- **Express.js + TypeScript**: Secure API proxy for OpenAI requests
- **Rate limiting**: 20 requests/minute per IP address
- **Request validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe API contracts
- **Security**: API keys stored server-side only, never exposed to client

**Conversation Design**
- **Structured JSON responses**: LLM returns typed JSON for itineraries/suggestions, making the UI predictable
- **System prompt engineering**: Clear format instructions ensure consistent, parseable responses
- **Stateful conversation**: Full message history sent to maintain context across exchanges

**Data Model**
- **Flat day structure**: Days contain items directly (no sub-nesting), keeping updates simple
- **Immutable updates**: Zustand uses spreading to ensure React re-renders correctly
- **Rich suggestion cards**: Embedded in chat messages, not separate state, keeping UX coherent

### Project Structure

```
src/                 # Frontend (React + TypeScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript interfaces (Trip, Day, SuggestionCard, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ store/           # Zustand store with localStorage persistence
â”œâ”€â”€ services/        # Conversation engine (fetch-based API client)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/      # React components (Chat, ItineraryView, SuggestionCard)
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx          # Main app orchestration
â””â”€â”€ main.tsx         # React entry point

server/              # Backend (Express + TypeScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Express app with CORS, error handling
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chat.ts      # POST /api/chat - OpenAI proxy endpoint
â””â”€â”€ middleware/
    â”œâ”€â”€ rateLimit.ts # Rate limiting (20 req/min per IP)
    â””â”€â”€ validation.ts # Zod request validation schemas
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Separation of concerns**: Chat UI doesn't know about itinerary logic; App orchestrates
2. **Optimistic updates**: Add/remove items update state immediately (no async wait)
3. **Graceful degradation**: Errors show banner but don't break the experience
4. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

## Content Approach

The conversation engine instructs the LLM to:
- Include 2-3 images per suggestion (using Unsplash-style URLs as placeholders)
- Provide 2-3 sentence summaries of "why it's popular/what to expect"
- Include 1-2 traveler quotes with both Chinese original and English translation
- Link to 1-3 sources (e.g., Xiaohongshu note URLs)

**For MVP**: Content is LLM-generated based on its training data. Production would integrate real APIs (Xiaohongshu, Google Places, etc.) for verified images/quotes/links.

## Limitations & Future Work

**Out of Scope for MVP**:
- User accounts / multi-device sync
- Actual bookings or reservations
- Map visualization or route optimization
- Collaboration (sharing itineraries)
- Budget tracking
- Offline mode
- Real-time content scraping

**Completed (Milestone 1.1)** âœ…:
- âœ… Backend API proxy to secure API keys
- âœ… Rate limiting (20 req/min per IP)
- âœ… Request validation and error recovery

**Next Steps** (See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)):
- Database setup (PostgreSQL)
- User authentication
- Real content sources (Xiaohongshu API, travel blogs)
- Image optimization and CDN
- Analytics and user feedback loops

## Testing

The primary acceptance flow is manual:
1. Start conversation: "9 days in Peru..."
2. Answer 2-3 questions
3. Receive realistic itinerary
4. Request "Rainbow Mountain" suggestion
5. See card with images/quotes/links
6. Add to day and see update
7. Request "less hiking, more food in Lima"
8. Refresh browser and see state restored

**Automated tests** (future): Could add Vitest + React Testing Library for component tests, but deferred for MVP to ship faster.
